        It all started when Irene was gifted a box full of colored markers and
        water color paint back in her kindergarten days and with the influence
        of anime, she started drawing her favorite characters using said colored
        markers and water color paint. This let her hone her artistic skills and
        by the start of her elementary days, she participated in poster making
        contests. She was then gifted a digital tablet which let her practice
        digital art.

        It all started when Kristan was doodling in the sand back when he was
        still in elementary school. He was trying to draw a t-rex and
        unknowingly, a crowd of children was watching his drawing and this
        boosted his confidence to continue drawing. Anime helped him improve
        since they served as motivation for him to draw. He used this talent to
        participate in poster making contests and editorial cartooning.

        Benjie started drawing due to his obsession with Black Pink. Most of his
        creations are works of art that depicts the beauty of Black Pink’s
        members. Using his computer literacy, even without a digital tablet, he
        uses Photoshop to create digital art.
